# XPath

XPath is a general language to select elements from XML language.
While the HTML is an XML then we can use the XPath to find elements.

# Page Object pattern

If we write more test the suites can get harder and harder to understand, so we introduce a level of organizing code.
We say that every page have it's own class that contains the actions that can be done on that page or information that can be claimed.

# Big assignment

All of you have to do a big assignment that have to be presented in the future.

Our next big assignment will be a selenium test that tests a webpage that available publicly on the internet and choosen by you.
Every student has to have to choose different website.


There are many task that you can do, but there are obligatory tasks as well.
These tasks can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwZlTShULZVSCxM-ew880VkdSffrruTUF229c-FsC5k/edit?usp=sharing).
You will need to copy this spreadsheet and fill the yelllow zones.
Watch out for the minimum requirements for grades from row 40 in the spreadsheet. For example if you do not ignore unnecessary files, you cannot get better than grade 2.


The steps of the big assignment:

- Find a webpage that has login and some basic functionality that wasn't choosen by anybody yet. You can find here the reserved pages in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pVWcnxBJkw6f9679S2l4ZuaLa-QWQEEYAoFtjM3Bbw4/edit?usp=sharing).
- Fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDvCWjhM4KrUV_1eQc45taf--5Uz798jruwcFd8vjvXVAyHg/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your webpage choose. By filling the form, your reserve will be added to the spreadsheet mentioned in the previous bullet point.
- Make your test program and publish on **Github** (Yes not on GitLab, now I ask you to use the public https://github.com/ to improve your visibility on the internet as programmer).
- Copy the [point spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lwZlTShULZVSCxM-ew880VkdSffrruTUF229c-FsC5k/edit?usp=sharing) and fill the github url and with the tasks that you have done. Share your spreadsheet with me with WRITE privilege hudi1989@gmail.com.
- Present your solution in a 1v1 call on Teams if you want to get grade 4 or 5. For grade 2,3 it is not necessary to present your work. I will publish possible presentation slots from 30th of May.  You have to be able to explain your work and convince me that you were doing it alone.

You have **2 weeks** to do the assignment, after that weekly you lose 1 grade. The deadline is same as was for the weekly tasks, so 4:00 AM.

So for examples, if you submit at:
- 20th of May 3:45 AM and you have points for grade 5, you only get grade 5 (in time).
- 20th of May 4:01 AM and you have points for grade 5, you only get grade 4 (1 week late).
- 27th of May 3:59 AM and you have points for grade 4, you only get grade 3 (1 week late).
- 27th of May 4:10 AM and you have points for grade 3, you only get grade 1 (2 week late). 

The presentation can be later than the finish, but your last commit matters in your repository about the late submission.
